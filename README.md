# Wificar23 - test repository

Writing an app with Android Studio and publish it to the Google Playstore is not straight forward. After some success I had to include the signing certificates, and it worked for a build to be uploaded to the Play Console. But then my local build no longer worked. It's probably easy once you write programs and have them published in a regular fashion, but for people starting to write their first program its a lot of hoops to jump through.

Another challenge is the .gitignore settings - either a lot of not so public data is included, or not enough to clone a repository on another computer.

Hence this test build repository.
